        <h3>Design & Development</h3>
        <p>I dicovered my joy for coding at 16 years old because I wanted to develop my own app! As time has passed I have been able to grow my understanding and admiration for design and development through my experience creating both mobile and web
          applications.</p>

        <h3>Beekeeping?</h3>
        <p>Well, not quite. I would say I have an acute skill that may come across as highly random but, is highly influential to me. My curiosity. I am facinated by new ideas and ventures. They manage to leave a lasting impression (a dream if you will) on me. This dream, I
          will forever aim to experience and perfect. <em>One of these dreams, is to own, and take care of, <strong>my own bees</strong>.</em></p>
